                I have been working at The Coder School, Encinitas for about a year now. In my time there, I have
                tutored a multitude of students, with ages ranging from as low as 9 years old to people in their 30s.
                Instruction ranges from simple tutorials like creating arrays, methods, or classes to more complicated
                projects such as building a web scraper or building a Discord bot.

            <p>
                My most notable events were coaching a student, Ryan, to 29th place out of 562 in a nationwide
                programming competition among theCoderSchool locations. Ryan was a freshman in high school working in
                Python, and I helped to prepare him and assist him through a series of 10 interview-style questions in 1
                hour. My other notable client was Jordi, who was a teacher in his 30s who wanted to learn about website
                and app development. Although perhaps a late bloomer, Jordi successfully walked through the steps of
                learning and was able to build his own small site by the end of our time together.
